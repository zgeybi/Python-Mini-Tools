# Description
The program, as the name suggests, can calculate terms of recursive 
sequences that use the previous two terms to calculate the next term and writes the result into a file
# Examples of such sequences
1. Fibonacci sequence
2. Lucas Numbers
3. Pell Numbers

# Instructions
1. Run from terminal using command: ```python3 Sequence_Calc.py```
2. User is prompted to enter the required data (you can get the k-th element if you need)
3. Output is written into a file "sequence.txt"
4. for a different sequence, change the formula inside "append" function
