# Instructions:
1. First prompt is an integer to specify how many number numbers to generate
2. Second prompt is an integer to specify the lower bound of the numbers you need
3. Third and last is an integer to specify the upper bound of the numbers you need
4. Then a file with the name `numbers.txt` will be generated and the list of numbers will be printed inside the file
5. First line is the number of numbers generated N
7. Then comes N line of randomly generated numbers

# Possible usage:
I created this program because I needed to test a sorting algorithm that I'm working on, so this program saved me the effort of going to
some website on the internet.

a. testing sorting algorithms with different numbers and different sizes of input \\
b. for some games maybe \\
c. i'm sure you might need it for something else
